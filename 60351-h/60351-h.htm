<p class='c010'>The movement set on foot by the
Board of Trustees to advance the interests
of Trinity exerts a stimulating
influence upon the College itself. The
students, feeling the impetus given,
have entered heartily into sympathy
with the new management. That another
door to literary work might be
opened to them, they have planned
and, with the approbation of the Faculty,
established <span class='sc'>The Archive</span>. Its
columns will receive and preserve their
best work. Dull efforts to say nothing
in many words, mild platitudes on ancient
classics, and meanderings through
hazy sentiment will be buried in the
dust of the top-shelf along with “Which
is mightier, the pen or the sword?” A
concise statement, however, of original
investigation in any department,
whether from student or from member
of the Faculty, will be welcomed; for
it has been determined that its aim
shall not be solely a literary one. It
is desired, also, that the paper be a
means of communication between College
and patrons. To this end, the circulation
will be extended as far as
possible over the territory covered by
the North Carolina Conference. Trinity
news, Trinity interests, Trinity announcements
will be made prominent.
The co-operation of clergy and laity,
especially of the Alumni, is asked in
putting <span class='sc'>The Archive</span> into general
circulation; for Trinity claims as her
patrons the whole membership of the
Conference.</p>

<p class='c010'>The responsibility of publication is
undertaken by the two Literary Societies.
The two Managers and ten Editors
are chosen out of their members,
and the Professor of English has been
designated Censor. Training in journalism
is a legitimate part of College
work. A proposition, however, to establish
a <span class='fixed'>Chair</span> of Journalism merits the
jocular tone with which the press has
greeted it. The practical exercise afforded
in publishing a paper helps to
make ready writers, and is a valuable
auxiliary to the regular course.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The College dominates the village,
and liquor cannot gain a foot-hold.
Friends of the institution could not lay
too much stress upon the fact. It is a
comforting assurance to parents that
their sons will not be exposed to this
temptation. Trinity lies next to a
strong temperance community, and
there is no danger that rum-shops will
be set up just beyond the College limits.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Examinations for admission to College
classes will be held twice a year,
in June and in September, on the latter
date exclusively at Trinity College,
beginning at ten A. M. on the day before
the opening. Applicants for admission
in 1888 will be required to stand
examinations on the following subjects:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Arithmetic, including Metric System;
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>

    <dd>Physiology and Hygiene;
    </dd>
    <dt>7.</dt>
    <dd>Latin Grammar, three Books of Cæsar.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>All students, on coming up to enter,
will be required to fill out a blank form
of enrollment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The entrance examinations, though
this year necessarily incomplete, have
secured beneficial results.</p>

<p class='c010'>The students have in the main fallen
into their proper classes without waiting
for the regular examinations to
show them their mistake.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the A. B. Course, fourteen hours a
week in recitation will be required of
the Seniors. Six hours will be filled
by assigned subjects, the other eight
being made up out of subjects chosen
by the student. The same number of
hours will be required of those applying
for the Ph. B. degree, but there
will be eight hours assigned work to
six hours elective.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The recitation rooms are full. Larger
ones with more black-board space will
be a pressing need, if the numbers grow.
The preparatory department also demands
that help which its importance
merits. Will the Methodists of North
Carolina see it, too, firmly established
and able to offer all the advantages of
a well-equipped school? Other denominations,
as well as the State, are
doing this. Few boys will remain for
a sentiment; they go where the greatest
inducements lie.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Till Congress meets and while Congress
shall wrangle over measures,
there is daily piled up in the national
Treasury a dangerous balance withdrawn
from circulation. Wall street is
nervous. Some permanent relief must
be devised. High tariff has the majority
and must solve the problem. <cite>The
Nation</cite> says:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Looking about for some lamb to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>slaughter or some pig to shear, the protectionists
have fixed their eyes upon
the sugar-planters as the class likely to
yield the largest fleece with the least
squealing. The revenue from sugar is
upwards of $50,000,000; the number of
planters is very small. Although they
have been reinforced to some extent by
the manufacturers of glucose and a few
sorghum and beet-root enthusiasts, they
amount altogether to a very feeble contingent.
Sugar is an article of prime
necessity. * * * * *</p>

<p class='c010'>“Accordingly we find such admirable
defenders of protection as Senators
Sherman, Dawes and Hiscock advocating
a reduction or repeal of the duties
on sugar, with a compensating bounty
to the growers of cane, beets, &amp;c., at
home. * * * * *</p>

<p class='c010'>“A bounty of $7,000,000 a year to
the sugar-planters, paid by warrants
drawn on the Treasury, would be a
very different thing in appearance from
a like bounty paid under the operation
of the tariff, although it would be the
same thing in fact. A bounty of $17,000,000
to the steel-rail makers, if paid
directly from the Treasury, could not
last a year. Yet that bounty has been
paid during the present year in the indirect
method of customs duties. We
can think of nothing more likely to expose
protection to irresistible assaults
than the adoption of the bounty system
in any single instance. We cannot believe
that the high-tariff fraternity will
be so short-sighted as to sanction it as
part of their scheme of ‘tariff reform.’
We are persuaded that they will offer
up the sugar-planters and the beet and
sorghum cranks as a sacrifice without
more ado, and be glad to get off so
cheaply.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Senator Leland Standford has in view
the endowment of a university for California.
His purpose is to build it with
“a sole regard to the poor,” so that
“no rich man’s son will want to come
there.” This is as it should be. When
the poor boys and girls of America
find an opportunity to become educated
men and women, they prove to be the
strongest and most energetic workers
in the cause of enlightenment; and all
those who desire the perpetuity of our
political, social and religious institutions
hail this action of Mr. Standford
with a special joy. Now, as never
before in this century, does our country
need great men at its head; and, if we
survive, must we not look, as in the
past crises, for our statesmen among
the frugal and uncorrupted laboring
class? Then let him who, having accumulated
a goodly fortune of this
world’s goods, desires to be remembered
for his benevolence, not forget that
in the intellectual and moral education
of the masses lies the destiny of the
grandest nation on earth.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Nothing is more vital to the welfare
of a college than a good library. There
is something else connected with the
acquisition of an education, besides
transferring to the mind the contents
of text-books. It is necessary to get
broad ideas and extended information
on each subject. This can best be done
by obtaining the opinion of several authors
on that subject, for it is only
when one has come to look at a subject
from several standpoints that he
can form a correct opinion relative to
it. It is here that the library makes its
influence felt by affording students access
to works which, owing to their
cost, they could not own. Those who
contend that the function of the library
is only supplemental to the college
course, should remember that life also
is supplemental to the college course,
and that the college course is but introductory
to the library function, both
in turn being introductory to life and
all three being links of the chain of
enlightened existence, the removal of
either of which would be detrimental.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The convicted anarchists now in
the Chicago jail awaiting execution
are making, through their friends,
strenuous efforts to have their punishment
lessened. A petition has been
presented asking for a reprieve. The
plea is that the peace will be preserved.
While we boast a reasonable amount
of mercy, still we can see nothing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>commend to our favor a petition which
is, at the same time, a threat. There
is abundant evidence that the introduction
of anarchists into our country is
for no good, and now is the best time
to strike a blow, which, being dealt
against a pernicious organization in its
incipiency, shall be all the more effective
in crushing it. Many people imagine
that, because eight thousand
names have been secured to this petition,
it deserves consideration; but,
let the sense of the people at large be
taken, and then we shall see how many
million names of good American citizens,
demanding the execution of this
sentence as a safeguard to them in the
enjoyment of their rights as free people,
shall be secured. Where the safety of
a nation is at stake, there is no place
for timid sentiment in the hearts of
those who are custodians of that safety.
Then, since a “jury of twelve of their
peers” has declared the six anarchists
guilty, let them hang and let others of
their organization take warning.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The policy of England toward Ireland
as expressed in her dealings with
O’Brien is peculiarly cowardly. It
should not be the part of unaffected
spectators to express themselves too
strongly on either side of a national
question like this, but no man, sane
and honest, can know the facts in the
case and not feel in his soul both contempt
for the English government and
sympathy for Ireland. That country
is indeed to be pitied whose proud
boast it is that the sun never sets on
her dominion, and yet is under the
guidance of a government which, to
forward its purpose deems it necessary
to resort to such measures as
those employed against Ireland’s patriotic
editor. The history of nations
shows that a policy of oppression toward
any part of a government will
re-act disastrously on the oppressors,
and the rulers of England, if they are
wise, will adopt a conciliatory policy
before they goad to desperation a race
of people who have more than once
shown themselves no unworthy foemen
for some of the proudest armies of
Europe. In the present condition of
the international political affairs of our
neighbors across the Atlantic, an outbreak
in Ireland would mean something
more than a rebellion to be
crushed; and the sovereign, the beginning
of whose reign was marked by
serious trouble in the East, might close
her career with that same East either
entirely snatched from her hands by
her Muscovite neighbor or the scene
of a long struggle for the mastery.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Read the papers and what spirit of
ferocity is often manifested in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“criminal columns.” There is an account
of some wretched man who, after
he has suffered death at the hands of
an infuriated mob, has had his body
riddled with bullets. Granting his
crime merited death, there is no principle
of justice in such action. It is a
violation of that right which the English
noblemen obtained from King John
at Runnymede, the right of trial by
jury. Moreover, it seems as if “judgment
had fled to brutish beasts and
men had lost their reason.” Besides
usurping authority, the mob is moved
by vengeance alone to inflict punishment.
Every reasonable man should
discountenance such procedure, but is
at the same time desirous of the just
execution of punishment upon him that
doeth wrong.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The Nestor of Southern statesmen
has recently given to the public his
opinions on prohibition. We heartily
agree with him that one of the strongest
weapons possible for man to
wield against the progress of intemperance
is found in the duty of every
mother to implant in the very souls of
her children the true principles of temperance.
While the children are young
is the time to give lasting life to ideas
which in later years will produce good
results for the suppression of the liquor
traffic and the elevation of mankind.
But this weapon is not used so successfully
as is necessary. We do not agree
with Mr. Davis that any inalienable
rights would be taken from the citizens
by the success of a new political
party with temperance for its issue.
If the State needs and even demands
a reform, if both Democrats and
Republicans are afraid to touch the
liquor problem, the formation of a
party that does not fear to suppress
social evils is a necessity.
Times change, and parties <span class='fixed'>must</span>
change. Moreover, it is no disgrace,
nay, even it shows a spirit of fortitude
for a man to change his politics, if he
finds that he can better promote the
welfare of his country. Slavery once
impeded our healthy development and
it took the organization of a party to
abolish it. The impediment of our age
is intemperance, and the demand of
the times is some political force—call
that force what you may—which will
free us from the tendency toward
degradation.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>There will be contests this fall in
several States, between the two political
parties, and the press in its comments
may attempt, as is too often
done, to vilify the candidates of the
opposite party. The best way to secure
success is for both candidate and
editor to treat every man according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>his worth and not rely upon low ribaldry
and exaggerated invective. The
man who attempts to succeed through
bitter recitals of the deeds of the past
will not only offend the finer sensibilities
of the best citizens but often
stands in danger of defeat among his
equals. Such a person ought to be put
on the retired list and preserved as a
specimen of humanity of two centuries
ago. Every man is expected to be
strong and enthusiastic for his party,
but no man should so far forget the use
of his reason as to call his neighbor a
rascal simply on account of different
political views. When a man’s character
will not bear the test then let the
press expose him. The publication of
prejudiced accusations, and the display
of cartoons devised by narrow-minded
partisans tend only to corrupt our civilization.
It is the purpose of <span class='sc'>The
Archive</span> to condemn whatever may
be wrong in every political party and
at the same time to maintain such
views as can be considered at least
liberal.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we go to press, the two Literary
Societies make a proposition to the
Board of Trustees to raise $5000 for a

if the Board will raise a like amount.
This proposition will be laid before the
Executive Committee at their meeting
in Greensboro, Nov. 4.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>The Practical Elements of Rhetoric</span>,
with Illustrative Example, By
John F. Genung, Ph. D. (Leipsic),
Professor of Rhetoric in Amherst
College. Boston: Ginn &amp; Company.
1887. pp. xii, 488. Cloth.</p>

<p class='c010'>This book has two parts, Style and
Invention. Part First analyzes style,
elements of style, qualities of style,
kinds of composition. Of the eight
chapters that make up the second half,
the first two are devoted to a discussion
of the principles that belong to
any literary work, and the remaining
six to the practical application of
them, as seen in the leading forms of
discourse. The author attempts to give
only the practical elements of rhetoric,
and in so doing his supreme effort is
directed to the demands of his subject
in order to bring out in its fullness what
is really beneficial to the student. As
old things, in proportion to their living
value, need from time to time to be
newly defined and distributed, so the
author has made a new and admirable
division of topics, each of which he
introduces with a simple and yet strictly
accurate definition. The arrangement
of topics and the treatment of the
same are, to say the least, fine, and
plainly show that the purpose of the
author has been very successfully accomplished,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>both in the expository and
in the illustrative matter. Genung’s
style is clear and impressive. He has
not merely compiled from other authors,
but, for the principles laid down,
has gone to the true sources, the usage
of the best contemporaneous writers,
to verify old rules and to lay down new
ones. He has by no means tied himself
to rhetoric descended from the
classics, his practical standard excluding
on the one hand, points whose interest
is merely speculative, and on the
other, discriminations that are only
named and defined, without directions
looking to use or avoidance. Furthermore,
the publishers have done well
their part, using every artifice to place
the treatise clearly before the student.
It is to be regretted, however, that a
word and phrase index was not added

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>A German Grammar</span> for schools and
colleges based on the Public School
German Grammar of A. S. Meissner,
M. A., Ph. D., D. Lit. By Edward S.
Joynes, M. A., Professor of Modern
Languages in South Carolina College.
Boston: D. C. Heath &amp; Co., 1887. pp.
ix, 322.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the author has based his work
upon that of Meissner, he has by no
means slavishly followed that Grammar,
but has greatly extended the
syntax so as to suit the higher schools.
In doing this, Prof. Joynes has consulted
the standard grammars of Whitney
and Brandt, and has received the
aid of distinguished scholars. The
subjects are excellently arranged, the
rules briefly worded, but clearly and
accurately expressed. There is nothing
superfluous. It is to be regretted,
however, that Prof. Joynes did not see
fit to treat more fully the prepositions;
for many dictionaries, especially such
as the student can own, are incomplete
in this very regard. A discussion,
therefore, of the prepositions with a
list of their constructions arranged for
reference would be of incalculable
value to the student. This Grammar
is already having a run and will prove
itself a formidable rival to those in the
field. Last but not least, the part intrusted
to the publishers has been
admirably executed, leaving in typography
nothing to be desired.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>King Solomon’s Mines.</span> By H. Rider
Haggard. Cassell &amp; Co., N. Y.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a book that all may read with
pleasure, mainly because it is something
out of the usual order. Being rather a
compromise between Robinson Crusoe
and the Arabian Nights, you are constantly
catching glimpses of these books
and yet at the same time, reading a
new story. The author takes an Englishman
to South America in search of
a lost brother who, as the Englishman
thinks, has found his way to King Solomon’s
Mines. Guides and other necessaries
being procured, the party set out
across the desert for these inaccessible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>mines. After overcoming many and
varied difficulties, they find the diamonds.
The party is shut up by the
old witch in charge of the cave; but,
finally escaping with many of her
jewels, they by chance find the lost
brother and return to civilization. The
author is not so unkind as to force his
truths upon you, but rather takes it for
granted that his statements will be received
as given, for no other purpose
than that of entertaining. There is a
vein of humor running through it that
makes the whole story very agreeable,
and even when most astonished at his
statements, you are compelled to laugh
at the courteous way in which they are
expressed. In originality of expression,
this novel surpasses the majority,
and adds a full book to Cassell’s “Rainbow
Series.”</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The Labor Movement in America.</span>
By Richard T. Ely, Ph. D., Associate
in Political Economy, Johns
Hopkins University. 1 Vol. Thomas
Y. Crowell &amp; Co. pp. 375.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every one who is even partially acquainted
with the present condition of
the laboring masses and with the
“marvellous war now being waged in
the heart of modern civilization” can
not fail to see readily the necessity for
some one to undertake to solve the
difficult problem with which this volume
deals. In view of this fact, and
being duly impressed with the weight
and importance of this issue upon
which the welfare of humanity depends,
the author has devoted much time and
labor, not only to the consideration of
this problem, but also to condensing
the results into a history, or rather, as
he says, a “sketch” of the different
labor organizations in America. The
work deals chiefly with the main current
of social life, not finding room in
this volume to deal with the many
separate lesser ones. He presents
rather than refutes the important statements
connected with this main <span class='fixed'>current</span>,
although he does not abstain entirely
from criticism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The topics are systematically arranged,
enabling the reader more clearly
to understand and more easily to retain
the accurate record of facts. His
sketch on “Early American Communism”
and that on “The Growth and
Present Condition of Labor Organizations
in America” are especially interesting
and instructive. His treatment
of the economic and educational values
of the labor organizations is masterly
and explicit, evincing a thorough understanding
of the great principles
upon which our social fabric is based.
In the Appendix are given the Platforms,
Constitutions and By-Laws of the
various labor organizations, which are
read with interest and profit, inasmuch
as the principles and complaints of the
laborer are clearly set forth therein.
The last words penned in the preparation
of the work are addressed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>working men. The caution and the
counsel given in this address would
prove of incalculable value to all whom
they concern. Were these heeded, inestimable
benefits would most certainly
accrue to all the laboring classes.
If they would pursue the course prescribed
by the author, they would be
much happier, wealthier and wiser.
They would learn to appreciate instead
of abuse the many blessings of this life.
Then the riots, strikes, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boycottes</span> and
outbursts of general discontent, for a
long time so prevalent in the land,
would soon become almost a matter of
history. The author’s abhorrence of
the many objectionable features connected
with the labor movement can
be plainly seen, although he does not
feel it incumbent upon him to call attention
to each one of them; but,
when it is necessary, he does not hesitate
to express his opinion touching
many of the schemes for destruction,
which he regards as “damnable.” This
valuable work closes with the remedies
for the cure of social evils. While they
can not be properly called a panacea
for all the ills, nor an elaborate scheme
of social regeneration, yet, as suggestions,
they are timely and well worthy
the careful consideration of the reader.
Every laborer, either contented or dissatisfied
with his present lot, should
read this book.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Archive’s</span> visit to any literary
magazine or newspaper may be considered
as an invitation to exchange.
Thus far the <cite>Wake Forest Student</cite> and
the <cite>College Message</cite> have been received.
<span class='sc'>The Archive</span> extends cordial
greetings to all periodicals which may
exchange with it, and trusts that harmony
may prevail between it and them,
and that mutual benefit may be derived.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>College Message</cite>, G. F. College,
is welcomed to our exchange list. We
are in receipt of the September number.
It contains some very readable articles
and some matter of a frivolous order.
Its pages, however, demonstrate the
fact, that women can occupy the editorial
chair with ability.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Archive</span> acknowledges the receipt
of a special copy of <cite>The Hot Blast</cite>,
Anniston, Ala. The print is plain, the
cuts clear, the general appearance
handsome, and the paper, on a whole,
does credit to the enterprise of the
company. This number is devoted
especially to the interests of Anniston,
and is calculated to infuse her citizens
with life, energy and pluck. The paper
is not a source of local pride alone,
nor is it devoted alone to local interests.
It proclaims the hidden treasures of
Alabama and the whole South. North
Carolina may well be proud that a part
of its pages are the fruits of North Carolina
talent, and it is an occasion of
gratification to Trinity that its city
editorial chair is filled by one of her
recent students.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last number of the <cite>Wake Forest
Student</cite> contains an article entitled
“Religious Life at College” in which
three reasons are propounded why a
Christian life and a College course are
uncongenial companions. These are,
first, that a student’s life is wholly of
an intellectual nature and that his religious
duties are made subordinate to
his intellectual work; secondly, that a
student’s associations wield a mighty
influence over his spiritual life; thirdly,
that a student is required to attend devotional
exercises. The first two reasons
are granted, and are too obvious
to need comment. The third is at
least debatable. When a boy first enters
College, he enters upon a new life,
and, as a general thing, discretion, as
to how he shall act and what he shall
do, is just as far absent from him as it
was in early childhood. It is just as
necessary that the Faculty should require
him to attend divine worship, as
it was that his parents should train him
in childhood to attend church and Sunday
school. In most colleges, in which
attendance upon divine worship is left
voluntary, many boys, who have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>accustomed to attend devotional exercises
at home, drop these duties, and,
from want of their ennobling influence,
fall into wickedness and dissipation. In
all such cases, the Faculty should act
<span class='fixed'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in loco parentis</span></span>. There is evidence
that a student can but feel the holy influence
of divine worship, though he be
forced into its presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same number of the <cite>Student</cite>
contains an article headed, “The
Sciences in Our Colleges,” by Prof. W.
H. Michael of that institution. The
Professor displays considerable thought
in his treatment of this subject. He
commences his article by saying, “The
emancipation of science from its servitude
to the dead languages in our
colleges seems every year to be more
strongly demanded.” He then goes
on to state his reasons for so thinking,
and sustains his positions by sound
arguments. An extended review of
the article is not intended, but merely
to call attention to the fact that the
demand for a more thorough study of
the sciences is rapidly gaining ground
in all parts of our country. Some few
years ago, Charles Francis Adams,
Jr., occasioned considerable discussion
among the literary periodicals of our
country by an address which he delivered
before the literary societies of
Harvard, in which he bitterly opposed
the study of the “dead languages” to
the neglect of the sciences, and regretted
that he had spent the most of his
college life in the acquisition of a
knowledge of the classics, while he
had learned scarcely anything of the
sciences. Although Mr. Adams was
somewhat of an extremest in his views,
yet his speech did great good by arousing
the minds of our greatest educators
to the importance of this subject, and
causing them, at least to some extent,
to bestow that thought upon it which
it deserves. Sentiment of late years,
in the higher educational circles, seems
to be changing in favor of a more liberal
study of the sciences in preference
to that of languages. The people of
the present day demand an education
which will both train their minds, and
be of practical use to them in everyday
life. They do not desire to live
mentally, as it were, in the past, but
want to be abreast with the great questions
of the present day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Davidson Monthly</cite> deserves
praise for the attention it shows to the
Alumni column. Its essays, however,
are long and lifeless, and its pride in
the possession of a “cow-boy” is most
too patent.</p>

HathiTrust Digital Library.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
